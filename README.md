**Dichotomies**

**Introversion (I) vs. Extraversion (E)**


Introverts (I): Energized by solitary activities, require time alone to recharge.

Extraverts (E): Energized by interactions with others, seek out social engagement.


**Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)**


Sensors (S): Focus on concrete, tangible details and present realities.

Intuitives (N): Interested in abstract concepts and future possibilities.


**Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)**


Thinkers (T): Prioritize logic and objective criteria in decision-making.

Feelers (F): Base decisions on personal values and how they affect others.


**Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)**


Judgers (J): Prefer structure, order, and decisiveness.
